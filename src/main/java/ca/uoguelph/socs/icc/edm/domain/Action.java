/**
 * A representation of the <code>Action</code> that a <code>User</code>
 * performed upon an <code>Activity</code> as recored in a
 * <code>LogEntry</code>.  Some instances of the <code>Action</code> interface
 * are general (such as viewing the content associated with an instance of the
 * <code>Activity</code> interface) and will be associated with may instances
 * of the <code>ActivityType</code> interface.  Other instances of the
 * <code>Action</code> may be specific to one particular instance of a
 * <code>ActvityType</code>, such as submitting an assignment.
 * <p>
 * Within the domain model the <code>Action</code> interface is a root level
 * element, as such instances of the <code>Action</code> interface are not
 * dependant upon any other domain model element to exist.  An associated
 * instance of the <code>Action</code> interface is required for an instance of
 * the <code>LogEntry</code> interface to exist.  If a particular instance of
 * the <code>Action</code> interface is deleted, then all of the associated
 * instances of the <code>LogEntry</code> interface must be deleted as well.
